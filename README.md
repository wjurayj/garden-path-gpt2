# garden-path-gpt2

Use the make_sents_{type}() method to build a list of sentences.
Arguments such as context and extension can be used to extend the length of a garden path effect
Arguments such as sent_type, comma, unreduced, and that can be used to negate garden path effects in various ways, as discussed in the paper.

Refer to this paper for more information about the methods used and key takeaways here: https://aclanthology.org/2022.blackboxnlp-1.25
