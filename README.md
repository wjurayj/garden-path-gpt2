# garden-path-gpt2

Use the make_sents_{type}() method to build a list of sentences.
Arguments such as context and extension can be used to extend the length of a garden path effect
Arguments such as sent_type, comma, unreduced, and that can be used to negate garden path effects in various ways, as discussed in the paper.
